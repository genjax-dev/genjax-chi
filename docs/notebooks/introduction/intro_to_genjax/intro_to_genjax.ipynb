    "## What is GenJAX?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few high-level ways to think about GenJAX:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A probabilistic programming^[New to probabilistic programming? [Don't fret, read on!](#what-is-probabilistic-programming)] system based on the concepts of [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Bayesian modelling and inference compiler with support for device acceleration (courtesy of JAX).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A base layer for experiments in model and inference DSL design.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's already a well-supported implementation of [Gen in Julia](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen.jl). Why is a JAX port interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of compelling technical and social reasons to explore Gen's probabilistic programming paradigm on top of JAX, here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* JAX's excellent accelerator support - our implementation natively supports several common accelerator idioms - like automatic struct-of-array representations, and the ability to automatically batch model/inference programs onto accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JAX's excellent support for compositional AD removes implementation and maintenance complexity for Gen's gradient interfaces - previously a difficult challenge in other implementations. In addition, JAX's support for convenient, higher-order AD opens up new opportunities to explore during inference design with gradient interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JAX exposes compositional code transformations to library authors, and, as library authors, we can utilize code transformations to implement state-of-the-art optimizations for models and inference expressed in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A lot of domain experts and modelers are working in Python! Some of them even use JAX (hopefully more each year). Presenting an interface to Gen which is familiar, and takes advantage of JAX's native ecosystem is a compelling social reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's truncate the list there for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the JAX literati, one final (hopefully tantalizing) takeaway: <u>by construction, all GenJAX modeling + inference code is JAX traceable</u> - and thus, `vmap`able, `jit`able, etc."

    "\n",
    "Here's one practical take on what probabilistic programming is all about: programming language design for expressing and solving Bayesian inference problems^[In the [Probabilistic Computing lab at MIT](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/), we also consider differentiable programming to be contained within the set of concerns of probabilistic programming. We won't cover differentiable programming interfaces in this notebook.]. \n",

    "Probabilistic programming is a broad field, and there are corners which may not be covered by this practical take. We'll just assume that people are interested in Bayes, and how to represent Bayes on computers in nice ways. For our purposes in this notebook, we'll stick as much as we can to the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we actually computing with?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objects which we program with expose a mixture of generative and differentiable interfaces - the interfaces are designed to support common (as well as quite advanced) classes of Bayesian inference algorithms. Gen provides automation for the tricky math which these algorithms require.\n",
    "\n",
    "We separate the design of inference (whose implementation uses the interfaces), from the implementation of the interfaces on computational objects. This allows us to build languages of objects which satisfy the interfaces - and allows their compositional usage and interoperability.\n",

We'll also be interested in what happened along the way: we'll record the intermediate and final results of these steps in `Trace` objects - data structures which contain the recordings of values, along with probabilistic metadata like the score of random choices selected along the way.\n",
